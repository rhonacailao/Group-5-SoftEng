## Development Workflow & Governance

* **Version Control:** All code changes are submitted via Pull Requests mapped directly to GitHub issues.
* **Definition of Done (DoD):** Tasks are only moved to `Done` once code is reviewed, meets the testable acceptance criteria, and passes local validation.
* **Roles & Responsibilities:** Team members operate across specialized roles including Scrum Master, Backend Developer, DB Admin, UI/UX Designer, and Tester.
